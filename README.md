## Domino - IN DEVELOPMENT...
To start:
1. Clone repo
2. navigate to root directory (where package.json lies) and run npm install (or npm i)
  This will create the node_modules folder with all the dependencies.
3. Run npm run start (this starts the react "server") it will automatically bring a browser window pointing to localhost:3000
4. On a separate terminal window navigate to the /src folder and run node server.js
   This runs the backend api server that powers the socket programming behind the game.
