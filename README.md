## Domino - IN DEVELOPMENT...
To start:
1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`. This will create the node_modules folder with all the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run start` (this starts the react "server").
4. On a separate terminal window navigate to the /src folder and run `node server.js` This runs the backend api server that powers the socket programming behind the game.
